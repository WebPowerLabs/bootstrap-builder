            <p>There are many losses that we experience over a lifetime, including the death of a loved one, divorce, a move, the loss of a job, an emotionally absent parent or spouse, and many more.  When we are faced with the death of someone we love, the feelings from all of the other accrued losses over a lifetime can be magnified. The Heal My Heart workshop is designed to identify and address the intellectual answers we have been given since childhood for consciously or unconsciously asking the question, “How do I deal with this pain?”.</p>

              <h3 class="box-title"><span>C</span>omplete the past and begin again</h3>
              <p>To complete what is in the past we must begin the action of renewing our minds, become self-aware and see what lies in the foundation of our lives. This is the first step toward healing.</p>

              <h3 class="box-title"><span>O</span>thers are not prepared to help us deal with our loss</h3>
              <p>We must stop rationalizing or dismissing our feelings when we receive incorrect advice from our friends and family, or unhelpful statements from others such as, “I know how you feel”. Relief from our pain is lasting when we work through the natural process with guidance and proper tools.</p>

              <h3 class="box-title"><span>U</span>nspoken emotional communication</h3>
              <p>Unspoken emotional communication builds negative pressure inside of and over us. This negative energy has a terrible effect on our health, finances, work, and other relationships just to name a few. Who we are BEing inside of this pressure isn’t the “same person” we know we really are inside. Discover who you are BEing when difficult circumstances present themselves and learn to allow the person you were born to BE come alive again.</p>

              <h3 class="box-title"><span>R</span>estoring ourselves to present moment</h3>
              <p>Do you have regret from things said or done in the past? Are you worried about the uncertainty of the future? Learning to “be here now” creates a whole new perspective and opens us up to opportunities we would not be able to see. Our futures are created one present moment at a time. This is a powerful session.</p>

              <h3 class="box-title"><span>A</span>uthenticity in our relationships</h3>
              <p>Accepting the reality of the relationship in its entirety helps us be honest with ourselves. When we can match our inside feelings with our outside behaviors, we achieve authenticity at a profound level. We need to see our life and our relationship from a bird’s eye view revealing the patterns and habits we carried with us as burdens along our journey.  This session is key to you finding the solution to end the cycle of unresolved grief.</p>

              <p>Saying good-bye to the pain doesn’t mean we need to say good-bye to the positive memories. By learning how to unlock the shackles that keep us stuck, we are released to fly in the direction of our destiny.</p>

              <p>By this session you will have learned:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>How to become self-aware of the events that happen in your life, and the stories you are making up about those events.</li>
                <li>How to eliminate the negative stories that keep you stuck.</li>
                <li>How to prevent these stories from having power over you again.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Joy, peace, freedom and even a life of fun are possible to the person who is willing to take the little steps toward exchanging what she/he has known for what she/he has yet to learn.</p>
